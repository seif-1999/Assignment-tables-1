<td id="html">HTML: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard
<br/>
 markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
 <br/>
 With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms
 <br/>
 a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
<br/>
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or 
<br/>
from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
<br/>
 web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page 
 <br/>
 semantically and originally included cues for the appearance
 <br/>
 of the document.
<br/>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
<br/>
 With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
<br/>
 as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered
<br/>
 page. HTML provides a means to create structured 
 <br/>
 documents by denoting structural semantics for text 
 <br/>
 such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
<br/>
 and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
<br/>
 written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img /&gt;
<br/>
 and &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the
<br/>
 page. </td> 
<td id="css">CSS:Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet<br/>
 language used for describing the presentation of a document<br/>
 written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a <br/>
 cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside <br/>
 HTML and JavaScript.<br/>

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation<br/>
 and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This<br/>
 separation can improve content accessibility, provide<br/>
 more flexibility and control in the specification of <br/>
 presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages<br/>
 to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in <br/>
 a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition<br/>
 in the structural content.
<br/>
Separation of formatting and content also makes it<br/>
 feasible to present the same markup page in different<br/>
 styles for different rendering methods, such as <br/>
 on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser<br/>
 or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.<br/>
 CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the <br/>
 content is accessed on a mobile device.</td> 
<td id="js">JavaScript:often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,<br/>
 interpreted programming language that conforms to the <br/>
 ECMAScript specification. It is a language that is also<br/>
 characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based<br/>
 and multi-paradigm.
<br/>
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the <br/>
three core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript<br/>
 enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential <br/>
 part of web applications. The vast majority of websites<br/>
 use it, and all major web browsers have a <br/>
 dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.<br/>

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports<br/>
 event-driven, functional, and imperative (including <br/>
 object-oriented and prototype-based) programming<br/>
 styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays,<br/>
 dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the <br/>
 language itself does not include any I/O, such as<br/>
 networking, storage, or graphics facilities,<br/>
 relying for these upon the host environment in<br/>
 which it is embedded.<br/></td>
